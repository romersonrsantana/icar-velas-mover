                <h3>Hospital Sant Pau</h3>
                <p>The Saint Hospital at the top of Gaudí Avenue in the Sagrada Família neighborhood is an oft-overlooked gem of modernist architecture. Although the building was begun in 1902 under the direction of the architect Lluís Domènec i Montaner, the hospital itself dates from the 14th century. It serves some 34,000 inpatients yearly, along with more than 150,000 emergency room...

                <h3>Cathedral Cloister</h3>
                <p>Outside it feels like a battle is raging, with firecrackers going off left and right in honor of Sant Joan, but in the cloister of Barcelona's 12th century Cathedral, it`s quiet enough to hear the trickle of the water from the fountain. As everywhere else in Barcelona, Saint George is slaying his dragon here. Somehow...</p>

                <h3>Market Day</h3>
                <p>
                    Quiet returns. And the refrigerator was empty, so off I set on my way to the market. The plan was homemade sushi with friends so I made the trip down to the central Barcelona market: the Bosquería.

                    I never get tired of coming here. There are rows and rows of busy stalls with fresh fruit and vegetables, and spices and nuts. And more than a couple of crazy tourists like me taking pictures. I confuse the locals by talking to them in catalan, but...

                Around the corner from our apartment there is a mosaics studio. Last year and the year before, I walked by and looked in wisfully, thinking how cool it would be to made some of the inacredible mosaics they have displayed.

                This year, I signed up. It's a 22 hour workshop, spread into 2 hour chunks. I've been going Monday and Wednesday mornings, and it's been great. I've learned how to cut ceramic tiles and also "gres" (their word for sandstone, and refers to a matte tile) and how to fit them together. I've got a bunch of ideas for more projects.

                So, the other day we make our annual pilgrimage to the <spain>Sagrada Familia</spain>,and my favorite part is always watching what they're working on, and there in the middle of the work area is a small pile of green and gold mosaic triangles, just like the ones I've been cutting...
